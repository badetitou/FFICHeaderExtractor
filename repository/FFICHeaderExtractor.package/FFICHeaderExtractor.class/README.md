The main task of this class is, given  the class variables (each class variable with the same name as a C constant) defined in a FFISharedPool subclass (for example SIGKILL, SIGTERM, etc), this class allows  the developers of a FFI tool, to automatically create a C program that writes all constants values, compile it, run it, and create a Smalltalk  init method which initializes the shared pool constants based on C program output. 

As for the input, this class requires all the following to have been specified: a shared pool (subclass of FFISharedPool) ,  platform name ('unix', 'Mac OS', etc), C compiler flags (for example, 'm32'), word size (32 or 64), the C headers to include ( for example #('signal.h' 'errno.h') ),  and the include files (if  the C headers are not in the usual place, they can be specified).

With all that input, this class is then able to autogenerate a C program that writes all the constants names and values into a file. Then compile it and run it. The C program will write a text file as a result with all the info. Finally, it can parse the output file, autogenerate an init method and compile into the shared pool class. This init methods can then be distributed as part of the FFI tool being built. At system startup, FFISharedPool will then take care of automatically running the corect init method based on the current platform.
