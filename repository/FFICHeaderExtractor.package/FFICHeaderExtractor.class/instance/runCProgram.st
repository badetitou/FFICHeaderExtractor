running C program
runCProgram
	"This method takes care of executing the autogenerated and compiled C program. The following is an example of a execution command for the shared pool FFITestingSharedPool for MacOSX 32 bits:
	
	cd /Users/mariano/pharo/imagenes; ./'FFITestingSharedPool.Mac OS.o' >> 'FFITestingSharedPool.Mac OS.log' 2>&1 
	
	As you can see, STDOUT and STDERR are redirected to #logFilename for analysis in case of errors.
