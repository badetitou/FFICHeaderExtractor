lookupInitMethodForCurrentPlatform
	"This method searches an autogenerated init method for the current platform. The lookup basically means checking the selectors in a specific protocol and search for the one (if exists) with the pragma matching the #platformName and #wordSize of the current platform. If found, it answers the selector. If not found, it answers nil. "
